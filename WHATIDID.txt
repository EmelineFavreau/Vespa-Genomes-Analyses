# overall analysis steps (see scripts directory)

1. analysing-genome-content: quast, busco
2. orthogroups-analysis: obtain proteins of longer isoforms, run orthofinder to get orthogroups
3. aligning-orthonucleotides: aligning protein sequences of each species' orthogroup (prank)
4. duplication-analysis: calculate number of duplication events in branches, blast unique duplication
5. calculating-dnds: calculate dnds on each orthogroup for branch and branch-site models (paml codeml)
6. analysing-crabro-rna: map RNA reads of V. crabro to the genome, obtain differentially-expressed genes list (nextflow, DESeq)
